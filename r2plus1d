a closer look at spatiotemporal convolutions for action recognition

in this paper we discuss several forms of spatiotemporal convolutions for video analysis and study their
effects on action recognition. Our motivation stems from the observation that 2d cnns applied to individual
frames of the video have remained solid performers in action recognition. In this work we empirically 
demonstrate the accuracy advantages of 3d cnns over 2d cnns within the framework of residual learning.
Furthermore, we show that factorizing the 3d convolutional filters into separate spatial and tempo
